The code 'run_analysis.r' does the following things - 

1. Reads all the raw files and combines them
2. Selects only the required columns
3. Renames the Activities appropriately
4. Renames all the columns appropriately
5. Creates a new dataset that is mean of all the columns and names them appropriately

The code then writes two tidy datsets as the output. These two are the datasets created in step 4 and 5
